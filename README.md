## Undotree

Undotree is a powerful VSCode extension designed to enhance the traditional undo-redo functionality by introducing a tree structure to track and navigate code changes more effectively. This extension provides developers with greater control over their development history, allowing them to view and restore previous versions of code without losing valuable information or trial-and-error attempts.

With Undotree, developers no longer need to worry about the linear limitations of the standard undo-redo system. Whether you want to revisit different approaches, compare versions, or navigate complex coding structures, Undotree is here to simplify the process.
